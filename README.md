Soundbite is a secure communications platform for building short-form audio experiences. At its core, our platform is web-api that can be leveraged to build highly customized
audio solutions. We provide a core set of NPM packages to help web developers interact with our
platform, and a series of fully functional UI widgets that can easily be embedded into an existing
application.

In this document you will find links to the NPM packages that we provide to help integrate our 
platform with your solution, as well as documentation to help you get started developing.

# NPM Packages
Our core NPM packages provide not only a Typesript client library for connecting to the API, but a complete data store system implemented in [mobx](https://mobx.js.org/README.html), and UI widgets in React. NOTE: our packages use [React version 16](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html) to preserve compatibility with Microsoft's SPFx framework.
