Soundbite is a secure communications platform for building short-form audio experiences. At its core, our platform is web-api that can be leveraged to build highly customized
audio solutions. We provide a core set of NPM packages to help web developers interact with our
platform, and a series of fully functional UI widgets that can easily be embedded into an existing
application.
